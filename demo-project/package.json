  "readme": "# react-asap\n\nThere are many different React starter projects, but as far as I've seen, the all seem to over-complicate the process.\nThis project starts simple and you can make it as complicated as you wish. The folder structure and the initial app render is completed for your convenience.c\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1\n\nrun `npm install react-now`\ncopy files from node modules into your project root\n\n### Option 2\n\nDownload the zip from the Github repo at [https://github.com/3stacks/react-boilerplate](https://github.com/3stacks/react-boilerplate)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Gulp Tasks\n\nrun `gulp` for the default task which builds the app to the build directory.\n\nrun `gulp watch` to watch files\n\nThat's about it.\n\nChange the build path at line 9 if you want to call the build folder dist or something like that.",
