# react-asap

There are many different React starter projects, but as far as I've seen, the all seem to over-complicate the process.
This project starts simple and you can make it as complicated as you wish. The folder structure and the initial app render is completed for your convenience.c

## Installation

### Option 1

run `npm install react-now`
copy files from node modules into your project root

### Option 2

Download the zip from the Github repo at [https://github.com/3stacks/react-boilerplate](https://github.com/3stacks/react-boilerplate)

## Getting Started

### Gulp Tasks

run `gulp` for the default task which builds the app to the build directory.

run `gulp watch` to watch files

That's about it.

Change the build path at line 9 if you want to call the build folder dist or something like that.
